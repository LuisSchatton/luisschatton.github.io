						In this university project, the assignment was to take an everyday object and take it out of its
						natural environment and bring it to life. I decided to bring a chessboard to life. In this scene
						I wanted to show the last, dramatic moment in the fight that an alive chessboard would contain.
						It’s the last move, ending the game. In the blockout I played around with scale and the camera
						positions. It was also important to
						get a feeling for how the scene should be constructed,
					</div>

					<div class="text">
						to allow a good readability of the scene
						and also a dramaturgy that intensifies the moment. The consclusion of this, was that the scene
						setting elements (f. ex. the clock) should be placed on the right in line with european reading
						conventions. Then from left to right you can see the acting piece piercing the passive piece
						which then results in the splatter of blood coming from the back of the piece.

						All of which was to intensify the moment and bring the struggle to life.
						All the different armor and set pieces were modeled and designed by myself.
						My utmost gratitude goes out to the people working at Mixamo, for providing the rigged mannequin
						I used for the figurines. Same goes for the blood splatter, which I got from Sketchfab (sadly I
						couldn’t find the name of the author anymore).

					</div>

					<div id="text">
						The armor was almost exclusively built by using common boxmodeling techniques.
						The Chain mail was made using the at the time completely new geometry nodes (the whole project
						was made in Blender 2.93). The lighting setup is also quite simple, which really emphasizes the
						textures on the models. It consists just of a hero light and a supporting ambient light.

						In this wonderful Workshop lead by Raphaël de Courville and Elena Falomo, we wanted to create
						some interesting experiences with the help of SparkAR. Since I’m really interested in Digital
						and Analog Clothing, I decided to enhance one of my favourite crewnecks with the help of
						augmented reality.
					</div>

					<div class="text">
						The item itself, a crewneck from Bape’s Spring/Summer 2020 Collection
						featuring a print reminiscent of Neo Tokyo from one of my favourite movies akira, features a
						badge on one of the sleeves containing an QR Code. Sadly the code doesn't lead to anything and
						since I got asked so many times, if the code is scanable, I decided to take matters into my own
						hands and just do it myself.

						The process presented by Raphaël and Elena was fascinating, since
						it combined digital and analog prototyping tools, which made it both fast and fun to try out
						different solutions. In the end I landed on a concept, also inspired by Akira. The helmet should
						be reminiscent of a motorcycle helmet, a nod to the infamous chase scenes in the movie and the
						metal arm was a reference to Tetsuo’s infamous transformation. To fit with Bapes theme, bot were
						made to look ape-like, so the helmet got some metal ears and the arm was made to look like it
						came from a cyborg gorilla.
					</div>

					<div id="text">
						Sadly the latter had to be scrapped, due to the limits of Spark AR
						at the time, which only supported 2 Dimensional overlays on the body. After modeling, I added it
						to Spark AR and added two little animations, which you can switch while viewing the AR Lens in
						Instagram. both of these are holograms, glitching in front of the helmet. I also added an HDRI
						to simulate the Helmet being actually in Neo Tokyo.

						Ryo Fukui - Early Summer 1976
					</div>

					<div class="text">
						In this course we used a sytematic approach in combination with different analysis techniques to
						translate a musical sequence into a semantic system.
						We chose the free Jazz track ‘Early Summer’ by Ryo Fukui to visualize. It’s a piece of free
						Jazz, which transports the listener into another world. To reflect this, we build a system, in
						which the viewer is also able to dive into the piece themselves. This lets the viewer analyze
						and explore themselves, transforming it into an interactive experience.

					<div id="text">
						To achieve this, we used different Javascript techniques. The background for example is run by
						it’s own audiovisualisation script, transforming its color to the beat of the drums.
						The spheres are all run by audiovisualisation capabilities of Blender and then brought into
						three.js, which allows them to run interactively in the browser. There, you orbit around the
						piece as it plays or even stop at interesting points in the song, allowing you to see the
						movement frozen in time.

					</div>

					<div id="text">
						Through this programmatic approach to creating this visualization, it would even be possible to
						scale the system up to different songs. This makes it a tool, which can be applied to the
						analysis of a wide variety of different songs, even in other genres.
