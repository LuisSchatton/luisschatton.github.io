    <h1>About this Portfolio</h1>

    <div class="hidden" id="c_text">
        With this portfolio I wanted to push myself and my abilities to create something new. Since my passion lies in
        the field of emerging technologies and design, I wanted to explore the idea of virtual space. The metaverse has
        become a buzzword in recent years, describing everything from NFTs, Video Games to Social Hubs, sometimes with
        and sometimes without virtual reality integration. All of this muddies the waters around the concept and also
        turns the word into something, that's used more for communicating with shareholders rather than creators. I
        wanted to remove myself from this conception of the metaverse and rather use the opportunity to explore, what
        virtual spaces could look like, if they were built by the user/owner themselves and thus actually showcase their
        vision.

        The website is built completely in three.js, without the help of any external plugins. The rudimentary physics
        engine is completely self made, with inspiration from the three.js guide and a massive help from my friend
        (thank you Yannick!!!). All 3D assets and most textures are also self made, mostly ripped from my old projects
        files. The skybox was kindly provided by Jockum Skoglund, check out his website at the link below.

        Other than that, it was just a long winded process of bringing everything together into a coherent product. I
        hope you like it!
